Application built to maintain a daily hiking journal.  Allows for writing and maintaing entries without internet connection, and the ability to post them once you get reception.

Built with the Appalachan Trail specifically in mind, it contains features that are specific to that trail such as shelters and towns along the way.  It was initially built to post to trailjournals.com, but was altered to post to Tumblr instead due to some technical limitations of the previous site.
